# Markov Colorful Fireworks
---

## About 
I chose to create this project because the Mid-Autumn festival just passed a few days ago (September 10). The Mid-Autumn Festival, also know as the Moon Festival, is a traditional event 
celebrated by Chinese people. On this day, I usually celebrate with my family by creating lanterns, and eating moon cakes. Since I am not at home to celebrate with my family, I thought
it would be meaningful for myself to create a system about a tradition that is close to me. I 
chose to use fireworks as an art since Chinese people usually celebrate this event with fireworks. At the same time, I always wondered how impactful fireworks are towards the environment. I ask myself "how much pollution does one firework create?" which was the motivation
for this project. 

## Challenges
1. I pushed myself out of my comfort zone by tapping into another part of web development that I have never explored before. I have experience with web development but it was mostly creating functional objects on the frontend. I have never used an animation system with canvas, so it was difficult to learn the physics for the particles. 

2. This was an important challenge for me because it forced me to create something I actually care about. At the same time, it forced me to think creatively and made me explore different realms of web development that I have not been exposed to.

3. I am really liking canvas and will apply some of the techniques I learned to my own personal website! 

## Is it creative?
I believe my system is creative because the system I created can give the users a glimpse of how much pollution fireworks can cause. When the firework explodes, it leaves a particle marks on the canvas for a few seconds(representing pollution). On my website, you can input the amount of fireworks you want to generate at once. We can see that as we generate more fireworks, say 5 vs 55, there will be more particle marks on the canvas. I have applied combinatorial techniques to create this idea. My firework system is inspired by another firework system (Credits to MinzCode). I also applied other techniques to make the system more creative such as adding input boxes to increase the fireworks generated.
